# LLM Resources

## Overview

Wormhole provides `.txt` files containing the documentation content and navigation structure. These files are prepared specifically for Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI agents.

You can use these files to:

 - Enable custom AI agents trained on the Wormhole documentation
 - Assist local or private LLMs for quick reference and technical support
 - Improve query results by providing direct access to documentation content

These resources are intended to help developers learn and understand the Wormhole Protocol. They contain documentation content only and do not include live data or protocol APIs.

## Full Documentation Files

Use these files to provide LLM access to the complete Wormhole documentation.

| File name          | Description                                                  | Download               |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| `llms.txt`         |  Navigation index of all Wormhole documentation pages        |  [llms.txt]()          |
| `llms-full.txt`    |  Full content of all documentation pages in plain text format|  [llms-full.txt]()     |

!!! note
    The `llms-full.txt` file may exceed the input limits of some language models due to its size. If you encounter limitations, consider using the [category-specific files](#category-specific-files).

## Category-Specific Files

For convenience, we provide LLM files grouped by product category. Each file includes:

 - All documentation pages related to that category
 - Foundational core concepts about the Wormhole architecture
 - Reference material such as chain IDs and contract addresses

This ensures that each file is self-contained and provides the context for practical use.
