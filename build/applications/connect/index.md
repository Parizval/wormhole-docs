# Wormhole Connect

<span class="badge product">Connect</span> | Best for: web developers, React apps, UI

## Introduction {: #introduction }

Wormhole Connect is a customizable widget that brings native and wrapped token cross-chain asset transfers directly into your web applications in as few as 3 lines of code.

Available as both a React component and a hosted version via CDN, Connect gives application developers cross-chain transfer functionality without the overhead of smart contract development or setting up complicated configurations for each supported chain.

The pages in these sections will cover features and benefits of Wormhole Connect, guidance on available token routes and when to use them, and configuration options to help you shape Connect to fit the needs of your application.

## Features and Benefits {: #features-and-benefits }

Wormhole Connect is easy to customize to suit your application's needs. You can customize details such as:

- Supported assets list
- Supported custom RPC endpoints
- Multiple ways to bridge assets using ([routes](/docs/build/applications/connect/routes/){target=\_blank})
- UI styling 
- Configuring any token to bridge via Wormhole
- [Ability to drop off some gas](/docs/build/applications/connect/features/){target=\_blank} at the destination

For more details about the features of Wormhole Connect and a breakdown of supported features by chain, be sure to check [the features page](/docs/build/applications/connect/features/){target=\_blank}.
